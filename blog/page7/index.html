			<h1><a href="/2017/07/16/news/">Important! Major changes</a></h1>
		

		<div class="post-content"><p>Hello guys !<br />
<br />
A forum where i was very active, codewalr.us, is talking about shutting down after 2 important staff members quit codewalrus.<br />
<br />
Since its creation, i almost made sure to make interesting posts, <br />
my T-Nspire CX ports as well as unrelated things.<br />
<br />
Unfortunely, it seems that Facebook &amp; Twitters are winning.<br />
Everyone is either talking about funny cats or making some pointless political shit.<br />
Everyone is sitting in their corner, with no center of interest or interesting discussions.<br />
It’s either social media or suffer the consequences of real life.<br />
<br />
To further avoid being in stasis, some changes will have to be made.<br />
<br />
<b>DellardOS</b>
<br />
First of all, i will be forced to cancel DellardOS.<br />
<br />
Custom distributions are becoming less and less popular and sadly, systemd along with its sister projects<br />
are taking over the league.<br />
<br />
Not all is bad though… <br />
Devuan made some progress and has finally reached Stable 1.0.<br />
<br />
…But it’s the exception rather than the rule.<br />
<br />
DellardOS failed to make any difference or even convince people they should use it on their old hardware.<br />
Although it works, my other set goals were never met.<br />
<br />
From now on, DellardOS will be removed off of my server and will no longer be available for download.<br />
<br />
If you installed DellardOS,<br />
you can easily install another DE like Xfce4 with this terminal command :<br />
<br />
<i>sudo apt-get install xfce4 slim<br />
sudo apt-get remove xdm jwm dellardos-system<br />
</i><br />
Once installed properly, reboot with :<br />
<i>sudo reboot</i><br />
<br />
If you can reinstall DellardOS though, do it because they might be some leftover files affecting the system.<br />
<br />
<b>Update my Website</b></p>

<p>Even one year after the website’s existance, it is still missing some games.<br />
The reason is simply because i made too many games/ports and i simply can’t keep up.<br /></p>

<p>This can be detrimental though, because of my games are erotic in nature<br />
and few websites cover such games unfortunely..<br /></p>

<p>On the downside, my main hard drive died.<br />
I lost precious stuff that i might never be able to recover.<br /></p>

<p>I really did not need to hear codewalrus’s demise…<br />
<br />
<b>Conclusion</b>
<br /><br />
That’s all for now. What will come next is some reviews for Yu-Gi-Oh Games
and my latest homebrew games. <br /></p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

			<h1><a href="/2017/06/11/android/">A look at Android-x86</a></h1>
		

		<div class="post-content"><p>Android-x86 is a project that intended to port Android to the x86 architecture.</p>

<p>Before even Android-x86, Google had released an Android emulator that’s actually running x86 binaries for performance reasons</p>

<p>However, the emulator was pretty slow at the time and it did not support 3D hardware acceleration, only a software renderer.</p>

<p>Originally, Android-x86 only targeted a few select hardware like the EeePC.
<br />
But KMS drivers were latter added to the mix,
<br />
which allowed 3D acceleration on AMD, Intel and Nvidia (via nouveau) as well as fixing some annoying crashes.</p>

<p>Android-x86 went from an experiment to a nice alternative to Linux distributions.</p>

<p>Anyways, what led me to try it out Android-x86 was due to the fact that the only powerful Android device
i had was my crappy Amazon Fire HD device, which quickly becomes hot even at low frequencies.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.gameblabla.nl/2016/12/16/FireHD7/">https://blog.gameblabla.nl/2016/12/16/FireHD7/</a></p>

<p>Another issue i had was the fact that Wifi was constantly disconnecting from time to time,
charging was very slow and overall it just became more of an annoyance than anything else.</p>

<p>At first, i tried to run it in a VM (Virtualbox) : 
<br />
it was working but it was also very slow.</p>

<p>So i partitioned my hard drive and i installed Android on a partition. 
<br />
(careful not to format your main partition !!!)
<br />
The last version of Android-x86 i tried was based on Froyo but now i’m trying out Android 6.0 Marshmallow r2.</p>

<p>When i first booted and went to Settings,
i was surprised to see that nouveau, the open-source nvidia driver, was fully supported in android-x86.
<br />
This was surprising, because several years ago, only a software renderer was available.</p>

<p>I quickly wanted to give Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Links a try and the improvement in frame-rates was immediately apparent.
<br />
The game was also much more stable on my PC than it was on my tablet.</p>

<p>Using my tablet, i constantly suffered from connection losses.
<br />
Using my PC instead actually improved my rank and allowed me to become King of Games.</p>

<p>Android 6.0-r2 suffered from another issue however : it would sometimes freeze after a period of time.
<br />
This irritated me so much that i decided to give the Nougat rc image a try.</p>

<p>Upgrading Android-x86 is painless, choose the partition where you installed it (Don’t format!!!)
<br />
and it will ask you if you want to upgrade it.</p>

<p>Android-x86 7.1 Nougat is even better than marshmallow : No freezes, newer mesa drivers,
the possibility to reclock your nvidia card via nouveau, the mouse works better in apps etc…</p>

<p>If your phone is too slow to handle an Android game then your PC running Android-x86 will most likely will,
as a low-end computer will run over many high-end phones.</p>

<p>My low-end PC got 143000 pts in Antutu. 
<br />
In comparison, the latest iPhone got 180000 pts.</p>

<p><b>Specs</b>
<br />
AMD FX 6350 3.5Ghz (configured as dual core)
<br />
Nvidia Geforce GT 730 GDDR5 2GB VRAM (reclocking enabled)</p>

<p>To enable reclocking, open the terminal app, type su (grant access) then type :
<br />
echo 0f &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/pstate</p>

<p>I could in theory get a better score by putting Android on my SSD and leave my proc with 6 cores.</p>

<p>AMD cards should perform even better than Nvidia cards.
<br />
But nouveau with reclocking still performs decently and will run all the heavy benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Negatives</b>
<br />
Some apps still do not have support for the Intel architecture.</p>

<p>Google tried to remedy this by introducing a compatibility layer in Nougat.
<br />
It doesn’t always work however, especially when hardware acceleration is used.</p>

<p>Audio doesn’t work over HDMI with Nouveau, even though it does on Linux distributions.</p>

<p>Nouveau also do not support accelerated codecs in Android, meaning it is impossible to play videos in an accelerated manner
or record your screen. 
<br />
This should be possible on Intel/AMD cards however.</p>

<p>The Google APKs are installed by default and can only be removed effectively from another Linux distribution.
<br />
(Duel Links actually runs without Google Play services, same for many games)</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b>
<br />
Android-x86 is probably the fastest way to play Android games, thanks to constantly improving drivers.
<br />
Duel Links is ultra-smooth on it, so are the benchmarks.</p>

<p>However, the benefits are not noticeable on a VM.
<br />
(Latest nougat version supports Virgil3D, but it still has a lot of overhead)</p>

<p>You can give it a try by putting it on a USB key with Rufus and use the “Live USB/CD” option to try Android
without installing it.</p>
