        <title>Buggy things on Linux</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Thought i would write up everything i encountered that was NOT working on Linux.
In particular, Void linux glibc. (fully updated of course)
It’s possible that these games could still run on the latest versions of Debian or Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My setup is a Ryzen 5 1500X with a Geforce 780 3GB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Doom 2016 (Windows, Steam)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;512&quot; src=&quot;/images/doom.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried Proton-GE 5.6, Proton 5.0 or even the older Proton release with Doom (2016) and no such luck with it…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game REFUSES to go beyond the initial loading screen. Sometimes, it does not even get there and crashes after the movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tried skipping the movies but that does not fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was using the proprietary Nvidia driver. I wish i had an AMD GPU so i could better troubleshoot it but i don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This game also does not work with Nouveau, i just get a black screen, despite the game being OpenGL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hatoful Boyfriend, Megabyte Punch (any Unity 4.x games)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;512&quot; src=&quot;/images/hatoful.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were older Linux releases that used to run quite nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I particulary enjoyed Megabyte Punch in particular and it ran pretty good even on an iGPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, trying them again on Void linux only leads me to a black screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do recall a black screen issue plaguing games like these, however the issue is completely different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because these games were Unity 4.x, the SDL2 workaround can’t be used as that was only used by Unity 5.6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess the games could be upgraded but none of those devs did. Worth asking them ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jemalloc trick also does not work… Running the x86 version crashes immediatly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Resident Evil Revelations 2 (Windows, Steam)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;256&quot; src=&quot;/images/rer2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another freebie that i got but never really tried to play until now.
Unfortunately, it does not work properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using it with the Nvidia proprietary driver leads to massive stuttering ingame.
Switched to the open source Nouveau driver and manually reclocked it, i’m getting worse performance
but it’s a bit more stable. Unfortunately, it still has annoying stuttering, it almost makes it unplayable.
Is my GPU throttling or what ? But after looking at the temps, they seem to be stable…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also if i quit and resume my save, it loads the scene and the screen is pitch black.
Great, another game that refuses to run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unreal Engine 4 Super Mario 64 remake&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;512&quot; src=&quot;/images/mario.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Windows game is very tricky to run : i don’t think anything on Linux can run it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried the proprietary drivers and the overworld is pitch black. (but you can still see water and mario itself)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nouveau driver in this aspect is even worse and half of the screen is missing on top of the other issues.
(Water is also missing)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bowser Castle is a bit more sucessful but still a mess unfortunately and it’s hard to know
if the fault is Wine, DXVK or the drivers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would have loved to see this running but unfortunately that won’t be the case it seems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What does work ?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PAC-MAN CHAMPIONSHIP EDITION 2 (no issues)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;.hack//G.U. Last Recode (works fine too, High settings require a beefy PC though)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Links (now works over Proton)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kao the Kangaroo : Round 2 (needs some editing for high framerates)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FFXV demo (works with proprietary drivers, haven’t tried nouveau yet)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Freedom Planet 2 (Multimedia Fusion 2 based)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;River City Ransom : Underground&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SkullGirls&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if i can recommend Void Linux anymore…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one thing, there’s no easy way of switching to Beta drivers unless you do it yourself.
The “stable” drivers have a lot of issues and nouveau unfortunately lacks a Vulkan implementation.
When it is not a GPU issue though, it’s even worse because it’s less likely you are going to find a fix for it unless you come up with a rootfs packaged
with the game, sort of like a flatpak i suppose…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can contact the devs of a Unity 4.x game, please tell them to upgrade the game to Unity 5.6+ as that has switched to SDL2
with a new Dynamic API option in case it does break in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately in some cases, it is not easily fixable.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cancel culture : Richard Stallman, Ion Fury</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I am aware that this is going to be a very controversial post.
But some people, in particular fringe activists, keep spouting non-sense so i felt like i needed
to share my views.
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;256&quot; src=&quot;/images/stallman.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;EDIT2:&lt;/b&gt; Again, it seems that all of the proof against stallman was false or greatly exagerrated.
&amp;lt;a href=”https://gnu.support/richard-stallman/Ludovic-Court%C3%A8s-Guix-is-accusing-Stallman-of-Thoughtcrime-on-his-own-domain-GNU-org.html&amp;gt;https://gnu.support/richard-stallman/Ludovic-Court%C3%A8s-Guix-is-accusing-Stallman-of-Thoughtcrime-on-his-own-domain-GNU-org.html&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That’s not to mention the fact they tried multiple times to deface his website over what ? his comments on the Epstein case ?
Something he is not responsible for anyway ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just what the hell guys… what the hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that he posted some comments bashing it on transgender people… i see no relation between them and Richard Stallman.
In fact, a lot of the “cries” came from women and men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;EDIT:&lt;/b&gt; She finally decided to post more proof to her claims. I invite you to look at it :
&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@selamie/remove-richard-stallman-appendix-a-a7e41e784f88&quot;&gt;https://medium.com/@selamie/remove-richard-stallman-appendix-a-a7e41e784f88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still don’t believe the matress thingy for example (he was sleeping in his office) and his claims about him endorsing “child rape” were misrepresented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it’s clear that he was making a lot of people working there very uncomfortable and was very socially awkward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very pissed off that either side is not being completely honest about what really happened because they seem to make it much worse than it seems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the comments seem to agree what really happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, i have decided to reconsider my opinion about the case and i won’t comment on it anymore and defend anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post on reddit pretty much summerise everything about the whole ordeal :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/d59r46/richard_stallman_resigns_from_mit_over_epstein/f0kym2e/&quot;&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/d59r46/richard_stallman_resigns_from_mit_over_epstein/f0kym2e/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still stand by what i said about Ion Fury though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Here’s the original blog post.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone (on medium) alleged that Stallman was endorsing Epstein because he allegedly defended Epstein and even endorsed him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when you look at said messages, you can clearly see that this is not the case and they misrepresented him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://libreledger.net/2019/09/17/the-medias-hit-piece-on-richard-stallman/&quot;&gt;https://libreledger.net/2019/09/17/the-medias-hit-piece-on-richard-stallman/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically he was merely pointing out technicalities and he also suggested that one of the victims may have been initially willing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that, he further pointed that, given she was 17, it may as well have been legal in some US states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, that flew above the head of said accuser’s who demanded him to be removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had clarified saying that he never defended Epstein and had called him a “serial rapist” but obviously, they were not interested to know that and they never gave him the chance to clarify or change his mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were effectively more interested to remove him than to know the truth. (i also think Eipstein was a serial rapist)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention that he has nothing to do with said case and never knew Eipstein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s kind of like someone in your class distorting what you said and demanding you to be removed over said distortions….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And unfortunately, they fell for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Stallman resigned from both MIT and FSF due to the “incident”, which honestly was made up from the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a mistake, Stallman should have had never resigned because it proved them that they were “right”, even though they weren’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just insane that you could get yourself removed over theories on a case you have nothing to do with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Cancel culture needs to stop, seriously.
&lt;br /&gt;
Why is this happening to Stallman ?
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is shutting down Stallman helping rape victims throughout the world ?
&lt;br /&gt;
I doubt so !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will not help them gain more income, defend themselves from abusive people or defend them from abusive work policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those “activists” never opposed countries condemning gay people to death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They would always stay silent when extremist Islamists would spout death threats to gay people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They never condemned when Trump would attempt to pass laws allowing employers to fire people over being gay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They could have very well use their power to put pressure on those people but they are more interested to pressure people with no political power or decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, they are interested to go after their very own peers who do not hold such viewpoints and falsify whatever they said and remove them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have spoken to women in 3rd world countries and they can’t even earn money online because Paypal is not available there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s challenging for them to earn money online because they simply can’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But those activists are not interested to help them or their cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/ogay_soap.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;512&quot; src=&quot;/images/ogay_soap.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have seen it with Ion Fury being accused of being “transphobes” when it turned out that all it turned up was a soap with it written “OGAY”, an unknown easter that said “fagbag” (which according to the member responsible, never knew its meaning. They did boot him out for not revealing it) and a developer stating that no one should decide the gender identity of a baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have personally spoke to a transgender about it and she said that he said nothing wrong. Go figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That baby may as well become gay in the future, you can’t force him to become trans and deny him of this opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s up to him to decide. I can’t believe people think that such a view would be transphobic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing wrong with “OGAY” as it, there is nothing wrong with the word “GAY” and there is nothing wrong with homosexuality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How come that it is homophobic ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;560&quot; src=&quot;/images/4chan_falseflag.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that a far right troll on 4chan was responsible for the false flag operation and he did it sorely to cause chaos and revert the design of the protagonist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is ResetEra taking orders from a far right troll ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake though : the far right is just as responsible for enabling those people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they are going to use cases like this to further their own cause and spread religious fanatism and bigotry throughout the US and more worryingly, the world as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I know that some people had issues with Richard Stallman over some of his other views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, i think it is quite hypocritical that he would put his very own drawings under a non-free license when he would advocate not to use proprietary software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But regardless, that should never be used as a reason to shun him and shut down like that.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>More work on SMS Plus GX</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello guys,
Another quick update on SMS Plus GX !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, i realised that i broke save states along the way some time ago, and it took me some time to fix it.
It took me a while to fix it but i managed to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also found a bug in Fantastic Dizzy that was not in Ekeeke’s fork i believe but
i introduced it when i did not properly remove the overscan code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This resulted in horrible glitches in Dizzy when running in PAL mode…
This is now fixed of course but most people would not even notice it
because most games are forced to run in NTSC mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But i also decided to take a look at trying to improve the graphics on the RS-97.
Of course, i could wait for TonyJiH to add support for Bilinear filtering via the IPU
but i wanted to something better or at least more suitable for our testcase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upscalers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, i looked at Hq2x.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it does improve the visuals, the memory consumption is greatly increased and the only implementations
that does improve on that support only ARGB888.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other alternatives like xBRZ but again, same issue and it’s just as CPU intensive,
the RS-97 will certainly struggle with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a bit saddened a bit at first and i was about to give up on that idea…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scale2x&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Macintosh II was released, it only supported high resolutions.
This forced game companies at the time to either to revamp their games or simply double the pixels.
But Eric Johnston while working at LucasArt in 1992, came up with EPX to address the rough edges when doubling the pixels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not jawdropping, the results are decent and there’s no degradation or visual loss to the picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years later, unaware of EPX, Andrea Mazzoleni implemented Scale2x for the AdvanceMame project.
It produces a very similar graphical effect, though it is implemented differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After i found a simple implementation of it in pygame and giving it a try,
i knew i found the right candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Click on the pictures to see the details.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/edusoft_scr1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;/images/edusoft_scr1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Native (256x192) vs Scale2x (512x384)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/edusoft_scr2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;/images/edusoft_scr2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Scale2x (512x384 -&amp;gt; 320x240) vs Bilinear (320x240)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it does not look as good when downscaled to 320x240,
though i still think that it looks better than bilinear filtering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at least it doesn’t eat 60MB of RAM unlike Hq2x and the speed of it is still decent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Improvements&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are wasting a lot of performance when we try to downscale it.
By design, Scale2x cannot target other resolutions, it simply doubles the output.
Given that the RS-97’s screen resolution is 320x240, this forces us to downscale it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It used to be a heck of a lot slower when we were using SDL_SoftStretch so i used MAME4ALL’s simple
scaler code. Too bad that it does not use 32-bits pointers, we could have cut bandwith by half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the RS-97, this could be improved but only if TonyJiH implements downscaling via the IPU.
And he does not plan to work on that until next month…
Assuming it is implemented, we wouldn’t need to downscale back to 320x240, saving a lot of performance.
This would also mean that the bilinear code can go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and i also managed to make SMS Plus GX work on the Ritmix RZX-50 and it works ok,
if somewhat sluggish on games like Sonic 1 FM. That’s to be expected though, given the SoC.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My fork of SMS Plus GX (itself based on SMS Plus)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello guys,
i thought i would write this post to reflect me working my fork of SMS Plus and the progress and stuff
i made on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how it started ? Well at first, SMS Plus was nothing more than a port of SMS_SDL to the RS-97.
The RS-97 is best described as the closest thing to a sucessor to the Dingoo A320.
It had its fair share of issues at first but most of these got fixed with the advent of RetroFW by TonyJiH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/shadow_dancer.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMS_SDL is based on SMS Plus, an emulator by Charles Mcdonald. 
However the version it is based on was very old, the Dingux port itself had severe issues with sync, and 
it did not even support games like F16 Fighting Falcon &amp;amp; Rozetta no Shouzou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because these games required emulation of the TMS9918, which is also incidentally used by SG-1000 games.
Support for these was added in SMS Plus 1.3 and the only actual port to have updated to that base (and beyond) was the PSP &amp;amp; PS Vita ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was actually pissing me off because i couldn’t play these games and i was sure some people would complain to me
about that when playing games on their RS-97’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, my plan was to upgrade to that newer base and be done with it.
However along the way, i discovered that Charles Mcdonald also released later versions of SMS Plus :
1.5 (came with GPLv2 license but source code is lost sadly), and 1.8, which unfortunately became proprietary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/falcon.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMS Plus 1.5 added support for Korean mappers and that alone made me want to upgrade to the newer codebase.
However, i could not find a copy of it anywhere ! And version 1.8 was licensed under a proprietary license
forbbiding non-commercial license, an unforunate turn of events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of non-commercial clause issues, i discovered later that :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The YM core was also forbidding non-commercial, so was the Z80 interpreter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The PSG’s emulator license has a problematic license.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally what i did was to contact Charles Mcdonald about it and whenever he could change his mind about it.
I flat-out told him my goal was to make the emulator fully free software.
He did give me an answer and he told me that he thought SMS Plus 1.3 was the last version under the GPLv2. 
He also seemed to be unwilling to relicense it, given that he got legal threats from companies using his emulator,
before saying that making SMS Plus was a mistake on his part and he never wants to hear of it again.
But despite this, he did seem to agree with my move for switching it to a fully free software emulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short while after, i noticed that he deleted his SMS Plus repository from his github account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make that of what you will… But someone else did make a fork of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, i also contacted Maxim’s about his PSG code.
He said that he later licensed said code under a different license but he did use the (problematic) license at first.
Charles Mcdonald also told me his changes fall under his license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at first i was kind of stuck, i could only go as far as SMS Plus 1.3 or i could embrace SMS Plus 1.8
with its support for Korean mappers but compromise on the license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all of that didn’t matter anyway because i soon discovered another fork of SMS Plus…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SMS Plus GX&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/smsplusgx_icon.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMS Plus GX was an emulator by ekeeke for the Nintendo Wii/Gamecube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, i thought it was going to be yet another outdated port of SMS Plus to the platform.
Why ? I saw dozens of SMS Plus ports to other platforms and they all had their own shares of issues,
not to mention all of them being outdated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But i was very surprised to see that, not only did ekeeke have support for Korean mappers (apparently he got the code from Charles himself),
he also fixed other issues in games like Ys I Japanese version relying on a VDP bug only present in SMS 1 consoles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/safari_hunt.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also added other additions, like proper support for SG-1000 games and Colecovision support.
All of that was still licensed under the GPLv2+.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a surprise because he would later be unfamously known for switching Genesis Plus GX 1.6 from the GPLv2+
to a non-commercial license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say “he” but &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/173210/ba3033c5afba400023d1&quot;&gt;according to an email exchange&lt;/a&gt;, 
this was done upon the request of Charles himself. And the emulator stayed under such a clause ever since…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, such a move never happened with SMS Plus GX because ekeeke had discontinued the emulator before that date
and so it stayed under the GPLv2+.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the legal situation meant that i no longer have to worry about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, i was kind of excited. I was less so when my first build of it crashed horribly.
Even when compiled as a 32-bits binary, it was still prone to crashes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, i decided to rebase my emulator around it and scrap my plans for using SMS Plus 1.3.
This did require some fixing to the source code but i finally managed to have it working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/lemmings.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what about the Z80 interpreter ? Later i dug more into it and found that the same Z80 emulator
was later relicensed in MAME under the BSD-3 license.
Naturally, i dropped him an email and asked him if he could also relicense the old versions under
that license as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He told me that he won’t do that even though the license allows him to revoke the terms at anytime
because he said that older projects were using those old terms and it would create a bit of chaos.
He then suggested to me i should really use his MAME code (given it fixes things) and switch it to C
if that was my needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did try to switch it to C but it was going to take more time than i anticipated so i decided to look for another
solution and i discovered that PocketSprite had also an SMS Plus port and already switched the Z80’s interpreter to another
one based on EightyOne’s core. This was great, i only had to take their commit and make it compatible with SMS Plus GX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turned out however, this took a bit more time than i anticipated but i finally did make it work.
However, i would later discover its issues but more on that later…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;After the rebase to SMS Plus GX&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/badapple.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this was great : I had a new Z80 interpreter, the emulator supported more games (though most of them are a bit obscure) and i also
somewhat fixed the sync issue by using the blocking I/O feature in Portaudio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at first when trying out some homebrew like Bad Apple, it would flat out crash the emulator.
After more digging into it, it turns out the homebrew was so huge it would overflow the 8-bits variable reserved for the number of pages.
It was 256 pages big and since an unsigned 8-bits variable could only go as far as 255, it set itself back to 0, hence the crash.
This was trivial to fix and increasing it to an unsigned short fixed it, kinda : it also required PAL timings to run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So i added it to the database to known games requiring PAL timings.
However, the auto-detection by nature won’t work if you rebuild it from source or is modfied in some ways so be warned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fix is here : &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gameblabla/sms_sdl/commit/80aefb94565e1cd463991cfae8331b2e8205ab37&quot;&gt;Git commit 80aefb94565e1cd463991cfae8331b2e8205ab37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was nice and all but i later found out that the EightyOne’s Z80 core was vastly inaccurate.
I only disovered this after i ran the SMS VDP test ROM : it would negatively affect the horizontal &amp;amp; vertical sync.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for a while, i was back to using the old Z80’s proprietary interpreter again. Great…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while i was trying to find a solution for this, i fixed the other issues in the frontend code as well as the sync code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then i left it to rot for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pausing the development and resuming it months after…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sonicedusoft.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to February, RetroFW was released for the RS-97.
Compared to my older firmware Useless and 97Next, it finally fixed the flaws of either and greatly simplified the porting process
without requiring odd double lining. This was also the first release to have some compatibility with OpenDingux binaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also got a Bittboy and i was asked to work on a port for it.
Naturally i agreed to resume work on it and to look at whenever i could fix the remaining issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added support for more audio apis like ALSA, pulse, OSS (used on the RS-97), SDL, in addition to Portaudio &amp;amp; libao.
I can thank Reicast for those given that the audio specific code was actually fairly trivial. The SDL code was based on Dmitry’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also finally managed to switch it to MAME’s z80 interpreter, with the several improvements it comes.
I had to bring the SP fix from ekeeke version though but it’s a single liner so not a biggie.
(Said trivial fix was also reported by other people elsewhere, making it a fact)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/edusoft_2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was another issue i wanted to fix and that was Sonic’s Edusoft not booting without an official BIOS.
Because requiring a copy of Sega’s BIOS was hugely inconveninant, i decided to look for fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn’t take me long to find a potential fix for it, as Bock described it in lengh :
“The game breaks because it expects the vertical interruption bit to be set by default on the VDP, and wait for an interruption before writing any registers to the VDP.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then shows a screenshot of MEKA having VDP Register 1 set to 0x80 so i made a quick search in the VDP code and i quickly found the related code.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gameblabla/sms_sdl/blob/7be0fe6fced6ec4654c9a2f662aed2a34d369f09/source/vdp.c#L84&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the game requires that VDP Register to be set to 0xA0 (which is set by the BIOS apparently) then why was it set to 0x80 in most emulators ?
Look at the available VDP documentation left me empty handed : none of them mention what default values the BIOS sets the VDP registers to.
This is probably because it falls outside of what they actually cover and i couldn’t find any evidence of Charles found that it should be 
that value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So naturally i tried to catch what the BIOS actually does to the VDP registers and guess what ?
All of them return 0xE0 upon booting up a game. However, some of the BIOSes, including the Hang out one,
do set 0x80 at some point but then it is quickly changed to 0xA0 then finally to 0xE0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my theory is that 0x80 is actually a mistake on Charles Mcdonald’s part and he may have got that value
by assuming this would be the right value to go with. But as Sonic’s Edusoft shows, this is not the case
and all the games i tried so far seem to work fine with 0xE0. (And really, why wouldn’t they ?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opened a bug report on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocornut/meka/issues/43&quot;&gt;MEKA’s github repository&lt;/a&gt; to inquire more about this bit as there might be a reason
behind it but for now, i have decided to set 0xE0 as the default VDP value for all games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Colecovision stuff&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/kevtris.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So SMS Plus GX can also emulate the Colecovision : support for it was added fairly recently until it was discontinued (2010).
Support for that console was never added back to Genesis Plus GX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now of course, this is far from being the most accurate Colecovision emulator, as it is more of a nice addition.
It doesn’t support the Super Expansion Module (the only open source emulator to support it is BlueMSX)
not to mention MegaCARTs, which again BlueMSX is also the only open source emulator to support it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My version did not properly support it at first due to a mistake on my part, this was quickly fixed once i found out about it.
A really dumb mistake that allowed Colecovision games to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside is that it requires the official Colecovision BIOS. But….
It turns out pretty much all the Colecovision emulators require it. 
In fact, no emulators so far attempted to reimplement, even ColEM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of them provide a copy of the Colecovision and the legal status is not clear for those.
The Colecovision BIOS is not just a bootrom like the SMS’s one and actually provides
routines for programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were especially useful given that you could save some precious cart space at the time.
BlueMSX is provided with such a BIOS, so is ColEm it seems. It is not trivial to replace and no one
has tried to document it extensively like nocash did for the PSX for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you are on the RS-97, just put BIOS.col in .smsplus/bios and you should be able to play your Colecovision games
Just make sure your Colecovision games have the .col extension, otherwise it will fail to detect them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get the IPK package for the RS-97 with RetroFW here :&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>More RS-97, bittboy news</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello guys,
hope you had a great year. (A bit late for that but meh)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you follow my stuff on Dingoonity &amp;amp; youtube, you may have noticed that i got a bittboy and ported some stuff to it. Unfortunately, there’s still some more work to be done before it can be considered complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steward-fu ported some more stuff (including PCSX-Rearmed) but of course he has little regard for speed or quality control… he even admitted to me he does not play the games for long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, i ported Quake &amp;amp; Quake 2 to it, including the RS-97 and gave it to some people.
The Quake 2 port in particular took me almost a year before I got it to boot due to some portability issues with the code as well as compiler bugs that only got resolved in later buildroot releases. Really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also made a basic port of SRB2-Kart to the bittboy and it runs very sluggishly as you may have expected… I even applied some more additional optimizations to it and it still chuggles.
Bittboy v2 with fixed SD card bus actually runs that game better due to faster swap but it’s still a terrible experience so i can’t recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Btw, if you wonder and ask me : 
“Where’s the RS-97 port of SRB2-Kart ?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RS-97 would be much more suitable for this game but unfortunately, the old kernel (2.6.31.3) prevents it from even booting and even a later kernel release (2.6.35) will fail on that game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, what happens is that it loads all the stuff (wads and all) then it becomes stuck on the first bootlogo screen… Looking at the log, I am completely dumbfounded as to why it fails to go past that.
Perhaps it requires some more additional portability fixes ? But the same binary works on QEMU-MIPS with a slightly more recent kernel so yeah…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another 3D game I tried to port was Crafti, the minecraft clone that i’ve ported successfully to the Dreamcast. (also works on the TI-Nspire)
This game is very troublesome, like most of the time the 3D stuff refuses to work properly at all and would flat-out crash. This happens on both the bittboy and RS-97. I managed to port that game to the GCW0 without any issues and here I found out that it fails to even run at all.
This ran on an Nspire with 64Mb of RAM so I doubt that memory limitations is an issue at all so what gives ? Another game I should try with an older GCC release perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s the next step ? Quake 3 of course !
Unfortunately, this game requires OpenGL 1.1 acceleration, no software renderer is available.
There was a MorphOS release some years ago that used TinyGL so the code is very old and very MorphOS specific so that’s a huge bummer and pain in the arse.
This is one of the those games that would flat-out crash TinyGL so cheating won’t work here either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quake 2 basically required me to get rid of the shared-library stuff (far from a trivial task ! No one had done so for this game) and Quake 3 ups it to eleven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not just use Xorg along with Mesa3D then ? Well, if only I could get that to work !
Xorg simply refuses to show up no matter what I do. This is balls but I hope I can solve this.
I suspect this will require support for the linux console but it seems like I could wrong…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, If i can get Xorg to even show up xeyes, then I would be a happy man because it theorically means that i can use it together with Mesa3D’s software renderer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if this works properly, this should only be used as a last resort : Xorg is very memory-intensive and the same stuff that can run without it (SDL, Allegro4…) will run slower under Xorg.
Also, it’s the only way of running SDL2 stuff since it doesn’t support fbcon and it requires KMS/DRM for 3D acceleration in the console. We can only support fbcon for now so yeah, balls again…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why no one gave this a try before ? Well the odd screen resolution (320x480) and immature toolchain meant that it would have been all but useless, not to mention out of consideration.
RetroFW thankfully fixes this with its IPU implementation, among with other features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it doesn’t fix however, is the the ugly old-ass linux kernel. Sadly, pcerceui has no plans for merging JZ4760 support upstream, them niggas are too focused on the RetroMini, which uses a JZ4725B.
But Senor Quack told me that’s among their plans. (but none of them own an RS-97, how ironic)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I opened a wiki about those devices here :
&lt;a href=&quot;https://jzwiki.gameblabla.nl&quot;&gt;https://jzwiki.gameblabla.nl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you expect more RS-97 news : Senquack is planning to release part5 of the MIPS recompiler.
This update is important as it will be the first one with a fully assembly coded GTE implementation that uses the MXU :
this will make it one of the first software to make use of the MXU instruction set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for me, well I managed to greatly improve the HLE bios implementation. While doing so, i’ve fixed games like Digimon World (now booting up), Umihara Kawase Shun (now boots), Parasite Eve II (saving works), Medievil II (now goes ingame), LEGO Racers (saving works, mips rec will get an upcoming fix) etc…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senquack also told me that he made some HLE improvements on his side related to clocks. I can’t wait to see those, because some games like Nuclear Strike requires perfect timing with memory cards for saves/loading for example…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fair to see that these additions will make it the best PCSX release so far on this earth and I can’t wait to see it all running on the RS-97.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Btw, Senquack also fixed the Tetris with Cardraptor boot issue after I pestered him about it and the fact that Mednafen already had a fix. (complete with changelog and comment describing the issue)
PCSX-Rearmed accepted my PR to fix the game and my build of PCSX4ALL already contains the fix.
Due to a bug in the recompiler however, it will only work properly over interpreter. This should get a proper fix in part5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all for now, thank you. I am really getting tired of this shit I admit.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Back to N64 stuff and RS-97 news</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So it’s been a while again since i wrote anything on here.&lt;br /&gt;
I thought i might as well talk about what i’ve been doing recently !&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cen64.png&quot; /&gt;
After Cen64 got much accurate and the fact that libdragon became less of a disaster,&lt;br /&gt;
i’ve decided to fix my older N64 games. Unfortunely, they had some issues and wouldn’t run on real hardware.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Turns out the issues were multiple but the main culprit was mikmod.&lt;br /&gt;
I simply couldn’t make it work without it crashing horribly so i resorted to using the Flappy Bird N64’s homebrew port code for audio. &lt;br /&gt;
Many thanks to him btw ! His audio code in particular helped me a lot. &lt;br /&gt;
I’ve simply improved on it and made it suitable for my uses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/flappyn64_bybonhage.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I noticed that Bonhage’s Flappy Bird clone was using the RCP for graphics but i’ve decided to stick with software&lt;br /&gt;
rendering for the time being.&lt;br /&gt;
The reason why is due to a flaw in the N64’s GPU : the tiny texture cache,which is only 4k… &lt;br /&gt;
Even the Sega saturn had much more than that !&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://gameblabla.nl/img/op.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That means if you want to display a huge image for example, you would need to cut your bitmap into several pieces,&lt;br /&gt;
tell the RCP chip to display each piece at a time and repeat… &lt;br /&gt;
This is horribly tedious, hence the reason why i’ve decided to stick with libdragon’s software rendering.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://gameblabla.nl/img/evil_aussie_3DO.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, Evil Australians and Opossum Massage simulator are now fixed, complete with music, sound effects and analog support.&lt;br /&gt;
Check out my github repo if you want to take a look : &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gameblabla&quot;&gt;https://github.com/gameblabla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As for the RS-97 stuff, well i’m taking a big break from that kind of crap.&lt;br /&gt;
Simply put, that console is a piece of shit and they kept introducing new revisions.&lt;br /&gt;
My fixes were a mixed bag and there are still issues about it. No one else is interested in fixing those.&lt;br /&gt;
I’m tired of dealing with this alone so i gave up on that console for the time being.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Btw, Jutley released his firmware based on mine but he introduced regressions for Gambatte : it no longer works over TV-out &amp;amp; new units.&lt;br /&gt;
I can’t say i’m pleased but seems like nobody minds having broken emulators…&lt;br /&gt;
There’s also no guarantee that the new games works on new units.&lt;br /&gt;
But again, no one is interested to give it a try on those…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>RS-97 stuff and more</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After getting 2 RS-97, i worked on a new custom firmware for the RS-97.
&lt;br /&gt;
It took me a while, and it was quite painful but here it is for all the revisions as Internal.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://boards.dingoonity.org/ingenic-jz4760-devices/uselessrs97-internal-firmware-for-revision-2-1/&quot;&gt;https://boards.dingoonity.org/ingenic-jz4760-devices/uselessrs97-internal-firmware-for-revision-2-1/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, that forced me to fix a lot of stuff, most of which you can find on my github account,
&lt;br /&gt;
including a newer version of Handy based on Handy libretro which has an HLE Bios implementation.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, there are still some crashes here and there but for the most part, it’s a lot more stable
&lt;br /&gt;
than steward’s old firmware. Unfortunely, FBA does not work on it.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Update</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So there was an issue with the app’s UUID being wrong and shared by one of my games.
&lt;br /&gt;
I was sadly forced to fix that app because it was blacklisted by Rebble’s team due to that issue…
&lt;br /&gt;
I have updated the previous link and it is now found at :
&lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/5b349ff6fbaf9ae3340005c2?section=watchapps&quot;&gt;https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/5b349ff6fbaf9ae3340005c2?section=watchapps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Other than that, if you saw my Twitter, i got two RS-97 !
&lt;br /&gt;
It’s an open source console that is unfortunely, not the fastest thing around, not even remotely close…
&lt;br /&gt;
However, the build quality is better than the GCW0, which was woeful, and at least it’s fairly cheap.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I also have a gitlab account, that i made shortly before Microsoft’s rumors around github (now true as you know).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/gameblabla&quot;&gt;https://gitlab.com/gameblabla&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have more to say but that’s pretty much it. Bye guys and follow my repos !&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Western Ideals : New (last) Pebble game</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Again, it’s been a while.
&lt;br /&gt;
I did several things since then :
&lt;br /&gt;
I have released a port of Evil Australians for the Atari Falcon.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunely i still have no idea if it works properly on real hardware….
&lt;br /&gt;
But it works well on emulators.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/basalt_scr1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The second project was one that took me a month (with plenty of breaks…).
&lt;br /&gt;
It is my final Pebble game : Western Ideals. I had to scrap some plans
&lt;br /&gt;
because Fitbit plans to shutdown servers next month… Oh well.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/5b349ff6fbaf9ae3340005c2?section=watchapps&quot;&gt;It’s available here on the Pebble app store.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Source code : &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gameblabla/western_ideals&quot;&gt;https://github.com/gameblabla/western_ideals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all for now, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Update - Some Changes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since i have not done anything, even development-wise.
&lt;br /&gt;
Sadly, i have some real-life issues so i could not do much.
&lt;br /&gt;
When not developing, i mostly play Duel Links.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because the boards got haxxed by Hackers (already, thanks), 
&lt;br /&gt;
i have decide to remove it.
&lt;br /&gt;
I’ll try to think of a better way to create a board but PhpBB just isn’t it.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I will also create a wiki for Duel Links, because let’s face it :
&lt;br /&gt;
Gamea’s one sucks.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Link is here : &lt;a href=&quot;https://duellinks.gameblabla.nl&quot;&gt;https://duellinks.gameblabla.nl&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
That’s all for now, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
