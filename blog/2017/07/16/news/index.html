	<div class="post-content"><p>Hello guys !<br />
<br />
A forum where i was very active, codewalr.us, is talking about shutting down after 2 important staff members quit codewalrus.<br />
<br />
Since its creation, i almost made sure to make interesting posts, <br />
my T-Nspire CX ports as well as unrelated things.<br />
<br />
Unfortunely, it seems that Facebook &amp; Twitters are winning.<br />
Everyone is either talking about funny cats or making some pointless political shit.<br />
Everyone is sitting in their corner, with no center of interest or interesting discussions.<br />
It’s either social media or suffer the consequences of real life.<br />
<br />
To further avoid being in stasis, some changes will have to be made.<br />
<br />
<b>DellardOS</b>
<br />
First of all, i will be forced to cancel DellardOS.<br />
<br />
Custom distributions are becoming less and less popular and sadly, systemd along with its sister projects<br />
are taking over the league.<br />
<br />
Not all is bad though… <br />
Devuan made some progress and has finally reached Stable 1.0.<br />
<br />
…But it’s the exception rather than the rule.<br />
<br />
DellardOS failed to make any difference or even convince people they should use it on their old hardware.<br />
Although it works, my other set goals were never met.<br />
<br />
From now on, DellardOS will be removed off of my server and will no longer be available for download.<br />
<br />
If you installed DellardOS,<br />
you can easily install another DE like Xfce4 with this terminal command :<br />
<br />
<i>sudo apt-get install xfce4 slim<br />
sudo apt-get remove xdm jwm dellardos-system<br />
</i><br />
Once installed properly, reboot with :<br />
<i>sudo reboot</i><br />
<br />
If you can reinstall DellardOS though, do it because they might be some leftover files affecting the system.<br />
<br />
<b>Update my Website</b></p>

<p>Even one year after the website’s existance, it is still missing some games.<br />
The reason is simply because i made too many games/ports and i simply can’t keep up.<br /></p>

<p>This can be detrimental though, because of my games are erotic in nature<br />
and few websites cover such games unfortunely..<br /></p>

<p>On the downside, my main hard drive died.<br />
I lost precious stuff that i might never be able to recover.<br /></p>

<p>I really did not need to hear codewalrus’s demise…<br />
<br />
<b>Conclusion</b>
<br /><br />
That’s all for now. What will come next is some reviews for Yu-Gi-Oh Games
and my latest homebrew games. <br /></p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>
