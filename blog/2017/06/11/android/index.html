		<h1><a href="/2017/06/11/android/">A look at Android-x86</a></h1>
	

	<div class="post-content"><p>Android-x86 is a project that intended to port Android to the x86 architecture.</p>

<p>Before even Android-x86, Google had released an Android emulator that’s actually running x86 binaries for performance reasons</p>

<p>However, the emulator was pretty slow at the time and it did not support 3D hardware acceleration, only a software renderer.</p>

<p>Originally, Android-x86 only targeted a few select hardware like the EeePC.
<br />
But KMS drivers were latter added to the mix,
<br />
which allowed 3D acceleration on AMD, Intel and Nvidia (via nouveau) as well as fixing some annoying crashes.</p>

<p>Android-x86 went from an experiment to a nice alternative to Linux distributions.</p>

<p>Anyways, what led me to try it out Android-x86 was due to the fact that the only powerful Android device
i had was my crappy Amazon Fire HD device, which quickly becomes hot even at low frequencies.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.gameblabla.nl/2016/12/16/FireHD7/">https://blog.gameblabla.nl/2016/12/16/FireHD7/</a></p>

<p>Another issue i had was the fact that Wifi was constantly disconnecting from time to time,
charging was very slow and overall it just became more of an annoyance than anything else.</p>

<p>At first, i tried to run it in a VM (Virtualbox) : 
<br />
it was working but it was also very slow.</p>

<p>So i partitioned my hard drive and i installed Android on a partition. 
<br />
(careful not to format your main partition !!!)
<br />
The last version of Android-x86 i tried was based on Froyo but now i’m trying out Android 6.0 Marshmallow r2.</p>

<p>When i first booted and went to Settings,
i was surprised to see that nouveau, the open-source nvidia driver, was fully supported in android-x86.
<br />
This was surprising, because several years ago, only a software renderer was available.</p>

<p>I quickly wanted to give Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Links a try and the improvement in frame-rates was immediately apparent.
<br />
The game was also much more stable on my PC than it was on my tablet.</p>

<p>Using my tablet, i constantly suffered from connection losses.
<br />
Using my PC instead actually improved my rank and allowed me to become King of Games.</p>

<p>Android 6.0-r2 suffered from another issue however : it would sometimes freeze after a period of time.
<br />
This irritated me so much that i decided to give the Nougat rc image a try.</p>

<p>Upgrading Android-x86 is painless, choose the partition where you installed it (Don’t format!!!)
<br />
and it will ask you if you want to upgrade it.</p>

<p>Android-x86 7.1 Nougat is even better than marshmallow : No freezes, newer mesa drivers,
the possibility to reclock your nvidia card via nouveau, the mouse works better in apps etc…</p>

<p>If your phone is too slow to handle an Android game then your PC running Android-x86 will most likely will,
as a low-end computer will run over many high-end phones.</p>

<p>My low-end PC got 143000 pts in Antutu. 
<br />
In comparison, the latest iPhone got 180000 pts.</p>

<p><b>Specs</b>
<br />
AMD FX 6350 3.5Ghz (configured as dual core)
<br />
Nvidia Geforce GT 730 GDDR5 2GB VRAM (reclocking enabled)</p>

<p>To enable reclocking, open the terminal app, type su (grant access) then type :
<br />
echo 0f &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/pstate</p>

<p>I could in theory get a better score by putting Android on my SSD and leave my proc with 6 cores.</p>

<p>AMD cards should perform even better than Nvidia cards.
<br />
But nouveau with reclocking still performs decently and will run all the heavy benchmark.</p>

<p><b>Negatives</b>
<br />
Some apps still do not have support for the Intel architecture.</p>

<p>Google tried to remedy this by introducing a compatibility layer in Nougat.
<br />
It doesn’t always work however, especially when hardware acceleration is used.</p>

<p>Audio doesn’t work over HDMI with Nouveau, even though it does on Linux distributions.</p>

<p>Nouveau also do not support accelerated codecs in Android, meaning it is impossible to play videos in an accelerated manner
or record your screen. 
<br />
This should be possible on Intel/AMD cards however.</p>

<p>The Google APKs are installed by default and can only be removed effectively from another Linux distribution.
<br />
(Duel Links actually runs without Google Play services, same for many games)</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b>
<br />
Android-x86 is probably the fastest way to play Android games, thanks to constantly improving drivers.
<br />
Duel Links is ultra-smooth on it, so are the benchmarks.</p>

<p>However, the benefits are not noticeable on a VM.
<br />
(Latest nougat version supports Virgil3D, but it still has a lot of overhead)</p>

<p>You can give it a try by putting it on a USB key with Rufus and use the “Live USB/CD” option to try Android
without installing it.</p>
