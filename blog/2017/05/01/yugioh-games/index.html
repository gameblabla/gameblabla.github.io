		<h1><a href="/2017/05/01/yugioh-games/">Yu-Gi-Oh Games</a></h1>
	

	<div class="post-content"><p>Yu-Gi-Oh was at first only a Manga.</p>

<p>Only in the late nineties did they agree to expand the series to make real cards, anime and of course, video games.</p>

<p>I won’t cover all the Yu-Gi-Oh games mind you, only some of them.
 <br />
The first Yu-Gi-Oh game ever released was <b>Yu-Gi-Oh! Monster Capsule: Breed and Battle</b> for the PS1.</p>

<p>I never played the game but it looks like a tactical rpg game.<br />
(with some virtual pet elements, according to some ppl)</p>

<p>The odd thing is that the monsters look nothing like the real cards or even the anime.
<br />
It’s quite an oddity for me.</p>

<p><b>Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Monsters</b></p>

<p><img src="/images/titlescreen.png" />
Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Monsters for the Game Boy is the first game that tries to implement the rules of Yu-Gi-Oh.
<br />
It’s also one of the later GB games that support the Super Game Boy borders.
<br />
<img src="/images/bakura.png" />
<br />
Of course, the game had to be quite downsized : 
<br />
No monster effects, magic spells are very simplified etc…</p>

<p>The overall game itself also plays very slowly and can be at times very unforgiving, like here for example :
<img src="/images/blue_eyes.png" /></p>

<p>I was playing against Bakura and he summoned Blue-Eyes White Dragon like it was a normal monster. O_O</p>

<p>However, there’s a trick to get rid of it : If your monster field is full, the game requires you to place a monster anyway.</p>

<p>In this case, the cpu always ends up putting the monster over the Blue-eyes dragon. (lol)</p>

<p>So that’s how i was able to beat him.
<img src="/images/duelists.png" />
<br />
However…</p>

<p>The game requires you to beat each duelists 5 times ! Yikes…
<br />
I did that, but then the game throws at me more duelists to my face !
<br />
I beat them like 10 times each but the game won’t let me continue…</p>

<p><img src="/images/intro.png" />
Considering the Gameboy’s limitations, it’s not a bad first attempt.
<br />
Managing the deck is also not too hard, despite the language barrier.
<br />
I absolutely love the graphics, the characters are nicely drawn.</p>

<p>But the game itself does not look so hot.</p>

<p><b>Yu-Gi-Oh : Dark Duel Stories</b>
<img src="/images/titlescreen_duelstories.png" />
Here’s what is probably the first Yu-Gi-Oh translated in several languages : English, German and French.<br />
This one uses the same engine as the first one, with some differences.<br />
Except this one you don’t get to have Super Game Boy borders :’(</p>

<p>Compared to the B&amp;W game, <br />
you need here to explicitly end the turn whereas on the previous game, you needed to do so by setting each monster’s position each turn.<br />
However, this game is even more difficult than the first one was.</p>

<p><img src="/images/duel_stories_color.png" />
The first one had limitations that could be used to work around that but this one will not fool you around.</p>

<p>They also give you crappy monster cards as rewards whereas in the first game, you could get several blue-eyes white dragon.</p>

<p><img src="/images/monsters.png" class="left" />
<img src="/images/yugi.png" class="right" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Even though it’s in color, i don’t like how they re-colored the monsters or everything else for that matter.<br />
They picked the brightest colors they could, it seems. <br />
I dislike this one even more so than the first one.</p>

<p><b>Yu-Gi-Oh : Forbidden Memories</b>
<img src="/images/forbidden.png" />
Most people are familiar with this one, <br />
even though it was released quite late in the PS1’s lifespan.<br />
Interestingly enough :<br />
the Japanese version was released 3~4 years before the US/PAL release.</p>

<p>It’s infamous for being brutally difficult, with CPU opponents often having better cards than you could wish to have.<br />
(Looking at you, Henshin !!!)</p>

<p>The game also differs from the TCG rules (and the anime) by allowing you to combine monsters to create new monsters.</p>

<p>However, doing so means that you are closer to being decked out…<br />
It also restricts you to placing one card each turn so forget about using magic spells, you’ll get mauled by the enemy.<br />
It’s better than the old Game Boy games but not by much…
<br />
<br />
<b>Afterwards…</b>
<br />
<br />
After this, several (tons) GBA games were released. One of them is even based on the GX Anime series !<br />
Sadly, i played none of them extensively. Maybe i will do a review of some of them in the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Yu-Gi-Oh! Power of Chaos: Yugi the Destiny</b>
<img src="/images/power_of_chaos.png" width="480" />
Power of Chaos was released at discount shops in Europe such as Gifi for the low price of 10$. <br />
However, this game is perhaps the biggest travesty i have ever played.</p>

<p>Simply put : there’s only one opponent, no animations, no story, NOTHING !<br />
It’s more boring than the Gameboy games i swear !<br />
<font color="red"><b>AVOID</b></font>
</p>

<p><b>Yu-Gi-Oh : Nightmare Troubadour</b>
<img src="/images/nightmare_titlescreen.png" />
Nightmare Troubadour is quite an improvement over Forbidden Memories, let alone the GBA games.<br />
Managing your deck with the stylus is much easier and the graphics were also vastly improved.</p>

<p><img src="/images/nightmare_ingame.png" />
It doesn’t an amazing storyline (even though it’s based on the old Anime series) but it still makes things a bit more interesting.<br />
It becomes quite boring after you defeated Gozaburo and Noah though.\</p>

<p>At the time, i was complaining about the lack of support for Wi-fi. <br />
(it was released shortly before Mario Kart NDS)<br />
However, this does not matter now as servers are now dead.
<img src="/images/nightmare_duelists.png" />
Interesting note : the game has some kind of a primitive “love” system.<br />
The more duel and trade cards with him, the more he/she likes you.</p>

<p>Hell, you can even befriend with Pegasus !</p>

<p>At the time, this was a great addition to the NDS’s library. (especially at launch)<br />
It did not aged very well in my opinion though, especially compared to newer installments.
<br />
<br />
<b>Then after Nightmare Troubadour…</b>
<br />
<br />
After Nightmare Troubadour, tons and tons of Yu-Gi-Oh games were released for the NDS (and the PSP).<br />
They weren’t received well by the press, especially since most of them were rehashes of Nightmare troubadour.<br />
After the last 5D’s game was released in 2011, we got no Yu-Gi-Oh games until Legacy of the Duelists came out.<br />
I heard that it’s a pretty good game but sadly, i haz no monez.
<br />
<br />
<b>Yu-Gi-Oh : Duel Links</b>
<img src="/images/links.png" />
<br />
Duel Links is perhaps the biggest leap to Yu-Gi-Oh games since Nightmare Troubadour.<br />
The online-aspect of the game, even though it’s quite minimal, <br />
makes it hard to go back to the old games.<br /><br />
Compared to the original board game, some changes were made :</p>
<li>You can only set 3 Magic/Trap cards and Monsters.</li>
<li>Each character has a special ability that can alter the game.</li>
<p><br />
This might sound like they crippled the game but in the real game, <br />
you rarely have more than 3 monsters on the field anyway.<br />
Plus, it’s makes it easier to make a comeback victory.</p>

<p>The game has a PvP arena where you can fight friends or random opponents.<br />
I would lie if i said that all duels run smoothly but most of the time, they do.<br />
(even with a crappy wifi connection)</p>

<p>The game also contains a chat but it contains a filter for swear words.<br />
(my guess is that Apple imposed it to Konami and Konami brought that <b>“feature”</b> to the Android version as well)</p>

<p>Most of the time is not spent in the PvP arena though, even though you could.
<br />
Instead, you farm for cards and gems by fighting CPU opponents.</p>

<p>They respawn every 4 hours or when you fill all the missions objective.
What keeps you entertained are the numerous events this game has.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it’s the boring ones like the additional Bonus but sometimes,<br />
it’s a bit more involved like the Pegasus, Bakura or the KC Cup.</p>

<p>It’s not a perfect game… <br />
Some events mostly look like the same right now and once you reach a high stage, there’s not much to do.<br />
But it’s mildly entertaining for most people.</p>

<p>It has micro-transitions but it’s only to respawn enemies faster or buy more cards via the shop. I would suggest you give it a try. <br />
(unless you boycott Konami due to the Kojima fallout)</p>
