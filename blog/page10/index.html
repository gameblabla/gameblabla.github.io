			<h1><a href="/2016/11/27/x8/">Older devices - Sony Xperia X8</a></h1>
		

		<div class="post-content"><p><img src="/images/x8scr1_0_o.jpg" width="480" />
The Sony Xperia X8 was first announced in June 2010 and released in September the same year.
<br />
It was quite a low-end device, even for its time.</p>

<p>It has a 3” display with a resolution of 320x480, 6 physical buttons (plus the power button),
a 600Mhz Snapdragon S1 processor, a speaker, a micro-sd slot and a SIM card slot.</p>

<p><img src="/images/x8scr2_0_o.jpg" width="480" />
<img src="/images/x8scr5_0_o.jpg" width="480" /></p>

<p><b>Firmware</b></p>

<p>The device came with Android 1.6 but was later upgraded by Sony to Android 2.1.<br />
Sony said they could not upgrade it to Android 2.3 because the user experience was not satisfactory.<br />
However, custom ROMs are available for this device, all the way up to Android 4.4 Kitkat.</p>

<p>But before you can flash a custom rom on this thing, you need to unlock the bootloader.<br />
This took me a while but i eventually was able to unlock it through Sony’s website.<br />
After i flashed my first kernel with Flashtool, i flashed my first custom ROM.</p>

<p>My first custom ROM was based on ICS but i later found a port by yairpatch.
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwrKzof8Wpe4cHlkRFVScmUzVzQ/edit?usp=sharing">CM 10.2 (Android 4.3)</a></p>

<p>After some tweaking, i got Android 4.3 to run smoothly on the device.<br />
With the exception of Bluetooth not working well, everything else (Wifi, phone, accelerated graphics) works just fine.</p>

<p><img src="/images/x8scr8_1_o.jpg" width="480" /></p>

<p><b>Games</b></p>

<p>Now that my device is set up, i decided to play some games to see how well it performs.<br />
Most of them just flat out crash tho.</p>

<p>At first, i didn’t know why but i later found out it was due to developers building against
a recent SDK which compiles code that work only on armeabi-v7, despite claiming the contrary…</p>

<p>So most of the games that require Android 4.0 or superior will most likely not work.</p>

<p>Here are some of the games that do work :
<img src="/images/x8scr3_0_o.jpg" width="480" />
<img src="/images/x8scr4_0_o.jpg" width="480" />
<img src="/images/x8scr9_0_o.jpg" width="480" />
All of my Android games, including Rubby Bird, work fine on this device.</p>

<p>So when a game DO work, most of the time, it works fairly smoothly, even on Android 4.3.</p>

<p>Things that don’t work include Swing Copters 2, PPSSPP, Sonic Dash 2 and more…</p>

<p><b>Multimedia</b></p>

<p>Video/Sound support on this thing is what you would expect to be : OK.</p>

<p>It plays most of the common formats but it won’t do any miracles.
<br />
480p videos work on this device but i could not get 720p videos to work on this thing.</p>

<p>Do not think you can install a third-party app like VLC or MX Player to fix that
<br />
because they don’t work on Armv6 devices like the Xperia X8…</p>

<p>Anything higher than 480p is a waste of space/resources on the X8 anyways…
<img src="/images/x8scr6_0_o.jpg" width="480" /></p>

<p><b>Apps</b></p>

<p>Some modern apps still work on this but most of them, like Firefox, will just flat-out crash on it.</p>

<p>Why ?</p>

<p>Because the X8 uses an Armv6 processor, which are no longer supported and anything
built against Lollipop will crash on such a device.</p>

<p>I managed to make File Manager Pro and mLauncher to work on this so all is not lost
but Firefox for example, does not work on it…</p>

<p>I think the last version to work on it is version 33.0.<br />
I’m not even sure you can use Facebook Lite or Twitter on it…
<img src="/images/x8scr7_0_o.jpg" width="480" /></p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p>So there you go.</p>

<p>Is this good enough for basic tasks ? Yes.<br />
Is it cool to play with ? Perhaps.<br />
Can you live with this thing for 5 years and expect to use facebook, twitter… on it ?</p>

<p>No.</p>

			<h1><a href="/2016/11/27/haida/">Older devices - Sony Xperia Neo V</a></h1>
		

		<div class="post-content"><p><img src="/images/haidascr4_0_o.jpg" width="480" />
The <b>Sony Xperia Neo V</b> was released on October 2011.<br />
It was a cheaper alternative to the Sony Xperia Neo released previously in March of the same year.</p>

<p>It comes with a <b>Snapdragon S1</b> clocked at 1 Ghz, 512 MB of RAM,
a decent 5 MP Camera that can record at 720p, 7 hardware buttons,
a micro-SD slot that’s also used for the OS (great !) as well as a removable battery,</p>

<p><b>The device itself</b></p>

<p>The build quality isn’t very good : everything is thin plastic.</p>

<p>The battery and the back cover are very difficult to remove and easy to damage,
making the fragile plastic even more prone to scratches and breaking.</p>

<p>It’s really an easy device to break if you’re not careful and i’m lucky to have it in this state.</p>

<p>Looking at this device, you can see we’ve come a long way since then and now we’ve got phones using metal.</p>

<p><img src="/images/haidascr8_0_o.jpg" width="480" />
On the plus side, the screen is <b>scratch-resistant</b> and should suffice for most people.<br />
It also seems to be fairly solid but i wouldn’t try to break if i were you.</p>

<p>The camera is, considering when it was released, pretty decent actually.</p>

<p>It can record at 720p and the quality was better than what my cheap 100$ camera could do actually.<br />
This is still very bad at low light tho but i used it to record me playing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQj32LY4W8"></a> Quake on the TI Nspire.</p>

<p>This camera is also shared by all Xperia 2011 devices, except the <b>Arc S</b> which has an even better 8MP Camera.</p>

<p>Speakers are very loud and clear, although it’s mono only.
<br />
The hardware buttons work okay as well but most custom ROMs don’t seem to support the camera button tho so watch out for that.</p>

<p>The fact that you can boot the OS from the <b>micro-SD</b> slot means that you can easily expand the storage, 
as it is considered asÂ <b>Internal storage</b> for Android.</p>

<p>Should the <b>micro-SD</b> fail, you can also replace it.
<br />
You can’t say that for most other phone which can suffer from <b>NAND</b> failures… so that’s another plus for the <b>Xperia neo V</b>.</p>

<p>I also forgot to mention that the neo V supports <b>USB-OTG</b>, so plugging a USB stick or game controller will work.</p>

<p><b>Software</b></p>

<p>When i got the device, it was upgraded to Android 4.0 <b>ICS</b>.</p>

<p>Needless to say, performance was less than ideal for me on this thing and i quickly downgraded to Android 2.3 <b>Gingerbread</b>.
<br />
The phone ran a little better but i couldn’t customize it and most games stop supporting Gingerbread…</p>

<p>After settling with <b>Jelly Bean</b> for a while, i have just recently decided to give Marshmallow a try.</p>

<p>As recommended by the XPeriance team, i’m using it with a class 10 SD-card.
<br />
Marshmallow takes some time to boot but it runs surprisingly really well ! I’m actually surprised.</p>

<p><img src="/images/haidascr5_0_o.jpg" width="480" />
Of course i’m a sucker for speed so i replaced the default launcher with <b>mLauncher</b>, disabled animations,
disabled background processes and more…</p>

<p>My phone is now a bit more enjoyable to use.<br />
I would say it definitively runs better than the official <b>ICS</b> rom.</p>

<p><b>Games</b></p>

<p>I ran some games on it, none of them are really 3D heavy but the simple games run smoothly.<br />
By the way, my device was overclocked to 1.4 Ghz and the CPU governor was set to performance.</p>

<p><img src="/images/haidascr7_0_o.jpg" width="480" />
The latest version of <b>Angry Birds</b> runs smoothly, no issues so far.</p>

<p><b>Super Dangerous Dungeons</b> has some freezes but runs okay most of the time.
<img src="/images/haidascr6_0_o.jpg" width="480" />
3D games is where things start to get serious…<br />
The poor <b>Adreno 205</b> struggles to run most 3D games :<br />
my picks were not even that demanding…</p>

<p><b>PPSSPP</b> runs like on ICS and Gingerbread and most games will require frameskipping enabled.
<br />
<b>Minetest</b>, with the settings all the way down, runs at about 10 FPS.</p>

<p><img src="/images/haidascr2_0_o.jpg" width="480" />
Despite this, the device still manages to get 13000 points in <b>Antutu</b>.</p>

<p>For comparison, a <b>Lenovo A6000</b> would get like 24000 points.
<br />
In 3D tests tho, the <b>neo V</b> only got 86 pts, which is very low.</p>

<p><b>Multimedia</b></p>

<p>Naturally, i also tried to throw some MP4 720p videos at it :
It turns out the device supports full hardware acceleration for 720p videos.</p>

<p>Both <b>MX Player</b> and <b>VLC</b> were able to run my videos.</p>

<p><img src="/images/haidascr1_0_o.jpg" width="480" /></p>

<p>Sadly, i can’t really test 1080p videos but HW+ acceleration and YUV works great on this device
so i’m assuming <b>MX Player</b> should be able to play 1080p videos as well when fully overclocked.</p>

<p>Audio is the same deal, FLACs, OGGs, MP3s… everything will run on it.</p>

<p><b>Support</b></p>

<p>This device is well supported and while its support isn’t as good as let’s say the HTC HD2,
it still has ports like the now-defunct <b>Firefox OS</b>, <b>Sailfish OS</b> and plenty of custom ROMs.</p>

<p>This was a 2011 device and <b>Marshmallow</b> runs lovely on this thing, thanks to the XPeriance team.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure this phone will soon get a <b>Nougat</b> (7.0 and 7.1) update,
even though the only “improvement” Nougat provides is to able to run Google Assistant without crazy hacks.</p>

<p>Worth mentioning : the neo V has a <b>fastboot</b> mode so no need to tinker with the awful <b>Flashtool</b>.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p>The <b>Xperia Neo V</b> is pretty cool device to own and it was my mainly driver for a while.
The only thing that led me to switch to another is the fact that it didn’t support 4G.
If you only use 3G (or Wifi), it’s a really cool phone to own and one that should last you
for a while before Google drops support for 32-bits devices.</p>
<p>&lt;/div&gt;</p>
