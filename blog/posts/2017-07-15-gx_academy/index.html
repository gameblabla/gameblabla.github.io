			<p>After the abomination that was Reshef of Destruction,
i decided to see if Konami learned from their mistakes on the same platform.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/gameblabla/gameblabla.github.io/raw/simp/blog/images/gx.png" alt=""></p>
<p>2 years after the US release of Reshef, they made &ldquo;Yu-Gi-Oh! GX - Duel Academy&rdquo; in January 2006 in Japan and the US for the GBA.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not know if it got a proper release in Europe though&hellip;
Very few copies were released in Europe and only in the UK∕Germany it seems.</p>
<p>This game is based on season 1 of the then-new Yu-Gi-oh! GX series.
You play as you in the Duel Academy and you got selected after impressing the councellor.</p>
<p>The goal is to score high at the exams and duel everyone you encounter.</p>
<p>I mean, EVERYONE. And don&rsquo;t waste time !</p>
<p>Anyway unlike Reshef of Destruction, the game starts you with a tutorial&hellip;
except that it is excessive in lengh and content.</p>
<p>Nobody will want to sit and watch for 3O minutes watching the CPU play the game for us&hellip;</p>
<p>I skipped it anyway because i already know how to play Yu-Gi-Oh!.</p>
<p>Speaking of the game itself, it is a much better recreation of the card game than
Reshef which screwed over the rules.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/gameblabla/gameblabla.github.io/raw/simp/blog/images/gx2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>No crappy continuous monster effect detection, better graphics, managing your deck
is more pleasing than it was in Reshef and overall, it feels much more polished than previous games.</p>
<p>Getting cards is much easier than it was in Reshef and much more fair.
Plus, you start with 3000DP thanks to your parents which makes things easier.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, where the game fails is the plot.
Simply put most of the time, you&rsquo;re on your own and not much happens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s slow-paced and outside of dueling, there&rsquo;s not much to do.
Clearly, it was an after-thought for Konami.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/gameblabla/gameblabla.github.io/raw/simp/blog/images/gx4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After a while, you need to pass a test at the academy.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Theorical&rdquo; test can not be easy, even if you know the game well,
and you have limited time to answer each question.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Practical&rdquo; test is easy though, just make sure to destroy at least 10 monsters by battle.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/gameblabla/gameblabla.github.io/raw/simp/blog/images/gx6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I got the perfect score of 500/500.
Despite this, they let me know that i&rsquo;m still an &ldquo;Apprentice&rdquo; because i did not duel enough people !</p>
<p>If you want to study segregation, this is the game you need to play.
Silfer Red is the lowest-ranked of the three dorms and most people there drop out.</p>
<p>Your professor even goes as far as to conspire against them and trick them into expelling them !</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/gameblabla/gameblabla.github.io/raw/simp/blog/images/gx10.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then you have people like Chazz Princeton treating you like the lowest of the scums,
because you&rsquo;re a Silfer red and Alexis Rhodes calling you weak, even tho you beat the shit of them at the exams.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo;, then you can&rsquo;t talk them, simple.</p>
<p>Anyway, i didn&rsquo;t finish the game because it&rsquo;s too slow-paced and kind of boring.
Especially since i&rsquo;ve also played Yu-Gi-Oh Tag Force for the PSP,
which is in the same vein but so much better.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/gameblabla/gameblabla.github.io/raw/simp/blog/images/gx9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Also, the music is a bit better in quality : it certainly does not sound like a Game boy color game,
which Reshef did at times unfortunely&hellip;</p>
<p>Interestingly, the game is also riddled with lots of interesting bugs,
including one that allows you to  use Burst Stream of Destruction without Blue-Eyes White Dragon on the field as required !</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a marked improvement over the prequels but i would recommend you play the newer games in the series instead.</p>
<p>If you have a GBA though and you want to play a Yu-Gi-Oh game, it&rsquo;s probably one of your best options. (along with the GX 2006 championship game)</p>
<p>Be careful though because the game can be expensive, especially the European version complete with box.</p>
