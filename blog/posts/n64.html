			<p>So it’s been a while again since i wrote anything on here.
I thought i might as well talk about what i’ve been doing recently !</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/gameblabla/gameblabla.github.io/raw/simp/blog/images/cen64.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After Cen64 got much accurate and the fact that libdragon became less of a disaster, i’ve decided to fix my older N64 games.</p>
<p>Unfortunely, they had some issues and wouldn’t run on real hardware.</p>
<p>Turns out the issues were multiple but the main culprit was mikmod.
I simply couldn’t make it work without it crashing horribly so i resorted to using the Flappy Bird N64’s homebrew port code for audio.</p>
<p>Many thanks to him btw !</p>
<p>His audio code in particular helped me a lot.
I’ve simply improved on it and made it suitable for my uses.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/gameblabla/gameblabla.github.io/raw/simp/blog/images/flappyn64_bybonhage.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I noticed that Bonhage’s Flappy Bird clone was using the RCP for graphics but i’ve decided to stick with software rendering for the time being.</p>
<p>The reason why is due to a flaw in the N64’s GPU : the tiny texture cache,which is only 4k…
Even the Sega saturn had much more than that !</p>
<p>That means if you want to display a huge image for example, you would need to cut your bitmap into several pieces,
tell the RCP chip to display each piece at a time and repeat…</p>
<p>This is horribly tedious, hence the reason why i’ve decided to stick with libdragon’s software rendering.</p>
<p>Anyway, Evil Australians and Opossum Massage simulator are now fixed, complete with music, sound effects and analog support.</p>
<p>Check out my github repo if you want to take a look :</p>

<p>As for the RS-97 stuff, well i’m taking a big break from that kind of crap.
Simply put, that console is a piece of shit and they kept introducing new revisions.</p>
<p>My fixes were a mixed bag and there are still issues about it.
No one else is interested in fixing those.</p>
<p>I’m tired of dealing with this alone so i gave up on that console for the time being.</p>
<p>Btw, Jutley released his firmware based on mine but he introduced regressions for Gambatte : it no longer works over TV-out &amp; new units.
I can’t say i’m pleased but seems like nobody minds having broken emulators…</p>
<p>There’s also no guarantee that the new games works on new units.</p>
<p>But again, no one is interested to give it a try on those…</p>
