<p>The <strong>Amazon Fire HD 7”</strong> is a FireOS tablet released in 2014.)
At 39$ refurbished (50€ in Europe), it is one of the cheapest tablet you can get out there.)
I would have recommended it, if it wasn’t for FireOS…</p>
<p><strong>FireOS is ass !</strong></p>
<p>It’s closed down, full of ads and it is also very slow.)
Worst of all, the bootloader is also locked on this thing !)
It’s almost as bad as iOS, i swear…</p>
<p>Thankfully, a <strong>Cyanogenmod</strong> port is available for this device but due to the locked bootloader, you are stuck with Lollipop.</p>
<p>To put CM on it, you need to install KingoRoot on it and gain initial root, install Chainfire’s SuperSU, install Flashfire and flash your CM zip with it.</p>
<p><strong>Why would you do that ?</strong></p>
<p>Well you get better perf, the stock user interface, no amazon bullcrap, it’s more secure and you can also if you want to, put Google Play on it.</p>
<p>I assume you are going to install CM on it but if you don’t have the courage to hack it, stay away seriously.)
It’s more trouble than anything else.</p>
<p><strong>Hardware</strong>
<img src=https://github.com/gameblabla/gameblabla.github.io/raw/simp/blog/images/firescr1_1_o.jpg alt></p>
<p>The tablet has a headphone jack, volume buttons, a micro-usb port, a power button, a crappy back camera as well as a micro-sd slot.</p>
<p>It comes with a <strong>MediaTek</strong> SoC with two <strong>Cortex A15</strong> clocked at 1.5 Ghz and two other <strong>Cortex A7</strong> cores also clocked at 1.5Ghz.)
Yes my friends, it’s a BIG.little configuration, which should in theory result in better battery life.</p>
<p>In practice however, it isn’t the case and this tablet drains up <strong>really fast</strong>.)
The sleep mode on this thing is absolute bullcrap thanks to the crappy Amazon kernel and it eats as much battery as if the screen was turned on.</p>
<p>Definitively don’t buy this if you care about battery life)
The <strong>PowerVR G200</strong> is also not very fast and it will be a bottleneck in many games but it should be ok for most games.</p>
<p><strong>Games</strong>
<img src=https://github.com/gameblabla/gameblabla.github.io/raw/simp/blog/images/firescr6_0_o.jpg alt></p>
<p>The tablet scores 26921 pts and Antutu classify it as a medium-range tablet.)
It’s not too bad actually : only the disappointing GPU brings this down.</p>
<p>Naturally, i also tried some emulators in there and the two Cortex A15 definitively helps it.)

<strong>Reicast</strong> runs fullspeed in most games, which is quite nice.</p>
<p><strong>PPSSPP</strong> on the hand, you can see the GPU is the bottleneck, especially after you play <strong>Metal Gear Solid : Peace Walker</strong>.)
That game runs at 45 FPS only in non-buffered mode and sometimes runs at 25 FPS.)
Don’t even attempt to play <strong>God of War</strong> or <strong>GTA</strong> on it, it will be very slow.</p>
<p><img src=https://github.com/gameblabla/gameblabla.github.io/raw/simp/blog/images/firescr3_0_o.jpg alt>
<strong>Minetest</strong> plays great on it at minimal settings, no surprise here.</p>
<p>Other games running great are <strong>Naught 2</strong>, <strong>Numolition</strong>, <strong>Angry Birds</strong>…)
Most casual games will run on it but don’t expect huge performance if you want to go beyond that.</p>
<p><strong>Other things</strong></p>
<p>This device supports <strong>USB-OTG</strong>, which is great.</p>
<p>What is not great though is the fact that the Micro-usb can quickly become hot with a USB hub with a flash drive and a controller plugged to it.</p>
<p>No wonder it’s called <strong>Fire HD</strong>.</p>
<p>As far as i know, support for it is not great : It is stuck on Lollipop and it is semi-abandoned by Amazon.)
It really sucks, especially with that locked bootloader.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>If you are just looking for a tablet to get into, the <strong>Fire HD</strong> might be great for you.)
But even in this case, you will only get its full potential if you install <strong>Cyanogenmod</strong> on it.)
Without that, you are stuck with Amazon’s limited ecosystem, with a slow launcher full of ads that eats your battery really fast.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a cheap emulation then i would suggest to pay for a more pricier device such as the <strong>GPD XD</strong> or even buying a Google Pixel C with a <strong>IPEGA</strong> or <strong>MOGA</strong> controller.</p>
<p>I’m quite disappointed with this piece of shit :)
i’m pretty sure Amazon sells it at a loss so it can promote its <strong>Appstore</strong>.)
(Maybe it’s using semi-slaves to build the device who knows)</p>
<p>So there, that’s the <strong>Fire HD 7”</strong> for you.</p>
<p>Unless you can unlock an Amazon device (like the HDX 8.5”), my suggestion is to not buy it.)
Simple.</p>
