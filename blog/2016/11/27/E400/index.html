The LG Optimus L3 E400 is an Android device first released on February 2012.
<br />
Even back when it was released, it was a fairly low-end device.</p>

<p>It is equipped with a very weak Snapdragon processor clocked at 800 Mhz and comes with 384 Mb of RAM.
<br />
It is preloaded with Android Gingerbread 2.3.6 and was mostly stock Android.</p>

<p><b>The device itself</b></p>

<p>It has a removable battery, as well as a micro-sd slot, which is also great.
<br />
It also has a very poor camera that is especially bad in low-light situations.</p>

<p>In any case, the picture has a lot of noise.
<br />
It also has 3 backlight buttons that acts as the back, home and menu button.</p>

<p>They work OK, i guess.</p>

<p><b>Firmware</b></p>

<p>While it was a decent phone at the time, it has aged poorly…\ 
at least on the stock firmware.</p>

<p>The stock firmware is very slow and memory hungry, even though it’s on Gingerbread.</p>

<p>However… The XDA community eventually released an Ice Cream Sandwitch custom ROM for it.</p>

<p>The one i’m using is MiniCM9 and installing the recovery was fairly straightforward thanks to the ROM Manager that you can find on the Google Play.</p>

<p>I would definitively recommend flashing a Custom ROM as it changes everything :
<br />
You have more up-to-date software, you can overclock the processor and it still manages to run faster than the bundled ROM !</p>

<p>After you installed your custom ROM, I would recommend to install mLauncher,
<br />
disable Google services, enable 16bit transparency and disable transition animations.</p>

<p>It should result in a much smoother device than the stock firmware ever was.
<br />
(I still insist the stock firmware was really bad)</p>

<p><b>Games</b></p>

<p>I wish I could benchmark it but Antutu requires at least a Jelly Bean device so we’re out of luck here…
So instead, I had tested a bunch of apps and games.</p>

<p>I first tried Super Dangerous Dungeons, an Adobe AIR game if i’m correct.<br />
The game runs mostly smoothly on it, with some infrequent frameskipping.</p>

<p>Due to the game running at a higher internal resolution, the game had to be resized to the lower resolution.
This makes the game look somewhat bad unfortunely.</p>

<p>Then I tried Shattered Pixel Dungeon on it and it works just fine on it.
Like Super Dangerous Dungeons, the game has to be resized to the lower screen resolution.</p>

<p>It still looks great though despite this.
<br />
Another game I tried was Reaper.</p>

<p>That game actually looks pretty good on this device but it has some touch issues on this device.
To jump, you have to tap at the top right corner, in a certain spot. (really strange)</p>

<p>Other than that, it works smoothly.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a lot of recent games do not work on this device and flat-out crash.<br />
Minetest, Sonic Dash 2… not to mention you can’t install some of the bigger games unless you put a micro-sd card in there.</p>

<p>Thankfullythough, the processor is an Armv7 processor.</p>

<p>As a result, it is a lot more compatible with modern apps than some other old devices on Armv6, like the Xperia X8.
<br />
(See my Xperia X8 review)</p>

<p><b>Multimedia</b></p>

<p>Now let’s talk about video playback on this device.</p>

<p>It is as you would expect it would be : it can only play 480p videos.</p>

<p>Not even MX Player could play 720p videos smoothly.</p>

<p>And unlike VLC, MX Player does not have frameskipping options, which might have helped on older devices.</p>

<p>480p videos are running smoothly but I haven’t tried Youtube but my guess is that it would only be able to play 240p videos or at best, 360p videos.</p>

<p>Not that it’s a huge loss anyway due to the low screen resolution.</p>

<p>Firefox also works on it but it’s not exactly fast…If you intend to browse with it,</p>

<p>I would recommend you to install AdAway, as Ads can be quite demanding on such a low-end device.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p>The LG Optimus L3 E400 is fairly low-end device that should cover most of your basic needs,</p>

<p>including some apps but you should pick up a better device than this one…</p>

<p>If possible that is.</p>
