	<div class="post-content"><p><img src="/images/x8scr1_0_o.jpg" width="480" />
The Sony Xperia X8 was first announced in June 2010 and released in September the same year.
<br />
It was quite a low-end device, even for its time.</p>

<p>It has a 3” display with a resolution of 320x480, 6 physical buttons (plus the power button),
a 600Mhz Snapdragon S1 processor, a speaker, a micro-sd slot and a SIM card slot.</p>

<p><b>Firmware</b></p>

<p>The device came with Android 1.6 but was later upgraded by Sony to Android 2.1.<br />
Sony said they could not upgrade it to Android 2.3 because the user experience was not satisfactory.<br />
However, custom ROMs are available for this device, all the way up to Android 4.4 Kitkat.</p>

<p>But before you can flash a custom rom on this thing, you need to unlock the bootloader.<br />
This took me a while but i eventually was able to unlock it through Sony’s website.<br />
After i flashed my first kernel with Flashtool, i flashed my first custom ROM.</p>

<p>My first custom ROM was based on ICS but i later found a port by yairpatch.
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwrKzof8Wpe4cHlkRFVScmUzVzQ/edit?usp=sharing">CM 10.2 (Android 4.3)</a></p>

<p>After some tweaking, i got Android 4.3 to run smoothly on the device.<br />
With the exception of Bluetooth not working well, everything else (Wifi, phone, accelerated graphics) works just fine.</p>

<p><img src="/images/x8scr8_1_o.jpg" width="480" /></p>

<p><b>Games</b></p>

<p>Now that my device is set up, i decided to play some games to see how well it performs.<br />
Most of them just flat out crash tho.</p>

<p>At first, i didn’t know why but i later found out it was due to developers building against
a recent SDK which compiles code that work only on armeabi-v7, despite claiming the contrary…</p>

<p>So most of the games that require Android 4.0 or superior will most likely not work.</p>

<p>Here are some of the games that do work :
<img src="/images/x8scr3_0_o.jpg" width="480" />
<img src="/images/x8scr4_0_o.jpg" width="480" />
<img src="/images/x8scr9_0_o.jpg" width="480" />
All of my Android games, including Rubby Bird, work fine on this device.</p>

<p>So when a game DO work, most of the time, it works fairly smoothly, even on Android 4.3.</p>

<p>Things that don’t work include Swing Copters 2, PPSSPP, Sonic Dash 2 and more…</p>

<p><b>Multimedia</b></p>

<p>Video/Sound support on this thing is what you would expect to be : OK.</p>

<p>It plays most of the common formats but it won’t do any miracles.
<br />
480p videos work on this device but i could not get 720p videos to work on this thing.</p>

<p>Do not think you can install a third-party app like VLC or MX Player to fix that
<br />
because they don’t work on Armv6 devices like the Xperia X8…</p>

<p>Anything higher than 480p is a waste of space/resources on the X8 anyways…
<img src="/images/x8scr6_0_o.jpg" width="480" /></p>

<p><b>Apps</b></p>

<p>Some modern apps still work on this but most of them, like Firefox, will just flat-out crash on it.</p>

<p>Why ?</p>

<p>Because the X8 uses an Armv6 processor, which are no longer supported and anything
built against Lollipop will crash on such a device.</p>

<p>I managed to make File Manager Pro and mLauncher to work on this so all is not lost
but Firefox for example, does not work on it…</p>

<p>I think the last version to work on it is version 33.0.<br />
I’m not even sure you can use Facebook Lite or Twitter on it…
<img src="/images/x8scr7_0_o.jpg" width="480" /></p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p>So there you go.</p>

<p>Is this good enough for basic tasks ? Yes.<br />
Is it cool to play with ? Perhaps.<br />
Can you live with this thing for 5 years and expect to use facebook, twitter… on it ?</p>

<p>No.</p>
