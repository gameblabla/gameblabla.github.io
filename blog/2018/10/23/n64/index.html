	<div class="post-content"><p>So it’s been a while again since i wrote anything on here.<br />
I thought i might as well talk about what i’ve been doing recently !<br />
<br /><br />
<img src="/images/cen64.png" />
After Cen64 got much accurate and the fact that libdragon became less of a disaster,<br />
i’ve decided to fix my older N64 games. Unfortunely, they had some issues and wouldn’t run on real hardware.<br />
<br /><br />
Turns out the issues were multiple but the main culprit was mikmod.<br />
I simply couldn’t make it work without it crashing horribly so i resorted to using the Flappy Bird N64’s homebrew port code for audio. <br />
Many thanks to him btw ! His audio code in particular helped me a lot. <br />
I’ve simply improved on it and made it suitable for my uses.<br />
<br /><br />
<img src="/images/flappyn64_bybonhage.png" />
<br />
I noticed that Bonhage’s Flappy Bird clone was using the RCP for graphics but i’ve decided to stick with software<br />
rendering for the time being.<br />
The reason why is due to a flaw in the N64’s GPU : the tiny texture cache,which is only 4k… <br />
Even the Sega saturn had much more than that !<br />
<br /><br />
<img src="https://gameblabla.nl/img/op.png" />
<br />
That means if you want to display a huge image for example, you would need to cut your bitmap into several pieces,<br />
tell the RCP chip to display each piece at a time and repeat… <br />
This is horribly tedious, hence the reason why i’ve decided to stick with libdragon’s software rendering.<br />
<br /><br />

<br />
Anyway, Evil Australians and Opossum Massage simulator are now fixed, complete with music, sound effects and analog support.<br />
Check out my github repo if you want to take a look : <a href="https://github.com/gameblabla">https://github.com/gameblabla</a><br />
<br /><br /><br />
As for the RS-97 stuff, well i’m taking a big break from that kind of crap.<br />
Simply put, that console is a piece of shit and they kept introducing new revisions.<br />
My fixes were a mixed bag and there are still issues about it. No one else is interested in fixing those.<br />
I’m tired of dealing with this alone so i gave up on that console for the time being.<br />
<br /><br />
Btw, Jutley released his firmware based on mine but he introduced regressions for Gambatte : it no longer works over TV-out &amp; new units.<br />
I can’t say i’m pleased but seems like nobody minds having broken emulators…<br />
There’s also no guarantee that the new games works on new units.<br />
But again, no one is interested to give it a try on those…<br /></p>
