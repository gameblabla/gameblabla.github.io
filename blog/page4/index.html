			<h1><a href="/2018/07/13/rs97/">RS-97 stuff and more</a></h1>
		

		<div class="post-content"><p>After getting 2 RS-97, i worked on a new custom firmware for the RS-97.
<br />
It took me a while, and it was quite painful but here it is for all the revisions as Internal.
<br />
<a href="https://boards.dingoonity.org/ingenic-jz4760-devices/uselessrs97-internal-firmware-for-revision-2-1/">https://boards.dingoonity.org/ingenic-jz4760-devices/uselessrs97-internal-firmware-for-revision-2-1/</a></p>

<p><br />
<br />
Of course, that forced me to fix a lot of stuff, most of which you can find on my github account,
<br />
including a newer version of Handy based on Handy libretro which has an HLE Bios implementation.
<br />
<br />
However, there are still some crashes here and there but for the most part, it’s a lot more stable
<br />
than steward’s old firmware. Unfortunely, FBA does not work on it.

		<div class="post-content"><p>So there was an issue with the app’s UUID being wrong and shared by one of my games.
<br />
I was sadly forced to fix that app because it was blacklisted by Rebble’s team due to that issue…
<br />
I have updated the previous link and it is now found at :
<a href="https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/5b349ff6fbaf9ae3340005c2?section=watchapps">https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/5b349ff6fbaf9ae3340005c2?section=watchapps</a></p>

<p><br />
<br />
Other than that, if you saw my Twitter, i got two RS-97 !
<br />
It’s an open source console that is unfortunely, not the fastest thing around, not even remotely close…
<br />
However, the build quality is better than the GCW0, which was woeful, and at least it’s fairly cheap.
<br />
<br />
I also have a gitlab account, that i made shortly before Microsoft’s rumors around github (now true as you know).

I have more to say but that’s pretty much it. Bye guys and follow my repos !</p>
