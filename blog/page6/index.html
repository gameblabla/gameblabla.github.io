			<h1><a href="/2017/07/16/gx_academy/">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Academy - Review</a></h1>
		

		<div class="post-content"><p>After the abomination that was Reshef of Destruction, <br />
i decided to see if Konami learned from their mistakes on the same platform. <br />
<br />
<img src="/images/gx.png" />
<br />
2 years after the US release of Reshef, they made “Yu-Gi-Oh! GX - Duel Academy” in January 2006 in Japan and the US for the GBA.<br />
It’s not know if it got a proper release in Europe though… <br />
Very few copies were released in Europe and only in the UK∕Germany it seems.<br />
<br />
This game is based on season 1 of the then-new Yu-Gi-oh! GX series.<br />
You play as you in the Duel Academy and you got selected after impressing the councellor.<br />
<br />
The goal is to score high at the exams and duel everyone you encounter.<br />
I mean, EVERYONE. And don’t waste time !<br />
<br />
Anyway unlike Reshef of Destruction, the game starts you with a tutorial…<br />
except that it is excessive in lengh and content.<br />
Nobody will want to sit and watch for 3O minutes watching the CPU play the game for us…<br />
<br />
I skipped it anyway because i already know how to play Yu-Gi-Oh!.<br />
Speaking of the game itself, it is a much better recreation of the card game than<br />
Reshef which screwed over the rules.<br />
<br />
<img src="/images/gx2.png" />
<br />
No crappy continuous monster effect detection, better graphics, managing your deck<br />
is more pleasing than it was in Reshef and overall, it feels much more polished than previous games.<br />
<br />
Getting cards is much easier than it was in Reshef and much more fair.<br />
Plus, you start with 3000DP thanks to your parents which makes things easier.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, where the game fails is the plot.<br />
Simply put most of the time, you’re on your own and not much happens.<br />
It’s slow-paced and outside of dueling, there’s not much to do.<br />
Clearly, it was an after-thought for Konami.<br />
<br />
<img src="/images/gx4.png" />
<br />
After a while, you need to pass a test at the academy.<br />
The “Theorical” test can not be easy, even if you know the game well,<br />
and you have limited time to answer each question.<br />
The “Practical” test is easy though, just make sure to destroy at least 10 monsters by battle.<br />
<br />
<img src="/images/gx6.png" />
<br />
I got the perfect score of 500/500. <br />
Despite this, they let me know that i’m still an “Apprentice” because i did not duel enough people !<br />
<br />
If you want to study segregation, this is the game you need to play.<br />
Silfer Red is the lowest-ranked of the three dorms and most people there drop out.<br />
Your professor even goes as far as to conspire against them and trick them into expelling them !<br />
<br />
<img src="/images/gx10.png" />
<br />
Then you have people like Chazz Princeton treating you like the lowest of the scums,<br />
because you’re a Silfer red and Alexis Rhodes calling you weak, even tho you beat the shit of them at the exams.<br />
<br />
If you don’t “upgrade”, then you can’t talk them, simple.<br />
<br />
Anyway, i didn’t finish the game because it’s too slow-paced and kind of boring.<br />
Especially since i’ve also played Yu-Gi-Oh Tag Force for the PSP, <br />
which is in the same vein but so much better.<br />
<br />
<img src="/images/gx9.png" />
<br />
Also, the music is a bit better in quality : it certainly does not sound like a Game boy color game,<br />
which Reshef did at times unfortunely…<br />
<br />
<b>Conclusion</b>
<br />
<br />
It’s a marked improvement over the prequels but i would recommend you play the newer games in the series instead.<br />
If you have a GBA though and you want to play a Yu-Gi-Oh game, it’s probably your only option.<br />
Be careful though because the game can be expensive, especially the European version complete with box.<br />

			<h1><a href="/2017/07/16/reshef/">Yu-Gi-Oh! Reshef of Destruction - Review</a></h1>
		

		<div class="post-content"><p><img src="/images/reshef-5.png" />
Yu-Gi-Oh : Reshef of Destruction was first released in 2003 in Japan but was later released the next year
for Europe &amp; the US.<br />
<br />
Sol Chevalsky wants to unleash Reshef and destroy the entire world !<br />
Ishizu wastes no time and tells you and your friends everything about Reshef and what will happen to the world.<br />
To prevent this from happening, you need to get all the millenium puzzles before Sol Chevalsky’s minions
and destroy Reshef.<br />
Meanwhile, the Neo Ghouls (lead by Bandit Keith), also want to gather the millenium puzzles at all cost.<br />
<br />
<img src="/images/reshef-0.png" />
<br />
You start with what i can describe as the one of the crappiest deck in the Yu-Gi-oh series.<br />
Simply put, your no-tribute monsters are too weak and don’t go beyond 800 ATK.<br />
Your spells are also crap, most infamously “Sparkles” which only deals 50lp of damage.<br />
(Each opponent starts with 8000lp…)<br />
<br />
<img src="/images/reshef-4.png" />
<br />
At first, you struggle a bit and it is not too difficult.<br />
As soon as you face the first millenium keeper however… the difficulty ramps up considerably.<br />
He uses monsters much stronger than you can have or even be able to use !<br />
<br />
If you want to get better cards, you will have to either get them by winning dueling (unlikely)<br />
or you can buy them at Solumon’s card shop.
<br />
<br />
HOWEVER… the amount of DP (ingame currency) he asks for one card is insane !<br />
A 1200-ATK beater will cost you 4000 DP, while your friends only give you 80 DP per duel.<br />
This is required because the first millenium keeper has several monsters with 900 ATK or more.<br />
<br />
<img src="/images/reshef-2.png" />
<br />
But let’s say that you have the DP required to have it… you can’t even use it !<br />
For some bulls*** reason, you also need to increase your duelist level to use a monster.<br />
If it’s not high enough, you can’t put it in your deck. UGGGHHH<br />
A simple monster with 1200 ATK requires you to increase your level to 140…<br />
and that alone can take several days !<br />
That’s just for only one card though, don’t forget that a deck has 40 cards !<br />
<br />
<img src="/images/reshef-3.png" />
<br />
Because i don’t want to spend a year just so i can beat that guy, <br />
i cheated and gave myself infinite money and maxed out my level.<br />
I could now buy good cards like Vampire Lord, Cocoon, Nuvia, Flash Assailant etc…<br />
With a good deck, the guy was surprisingly easy to beat.<br />
<br />
I got my first millennium item, the necklace and it indeed confirmed Ishizu’s worries :<br />
The world became engulfed in flames, with Yugi as the only survivor.<br />
<br />
Ishizu then tells us that to gather all the other pieces across the world.<br />
I’m not going to spoil you everything, other than the game becomes much more difficult<br />
after you meet Bandit Keith and going across the world does not sound as exciting<br />
as it sounds, sorry guys.<br />
<br />
<img src="/images/reshef-7.png" />
<br />
If the game is to be believed :<br />
Italians are dirty people living in sewers,  canadians are obessed with dinosaurs, <br />
the chinese are still making noodles at the great wall of china and <br />
some egyptians still believe in the ancient egyptian gods… yeah.<br />
<br />
Also, Mai Valentine being constantly harrased by some guy.<br />
<br />
The difficulty spikes right when you fight Marik.<br />
Despite the fact that i cheated, <b>i still managed to lose !</b><br />
<br />
That’s because he runs 3 copies of Raigeki, Change of Heart and Pot of Greed,<br />
even though you are only allowed 1 copy of each “Limited” cards but the AI is not under such restriction !<br />
<br />
You head off to Pegasus’ island and it becomes even more difficult : your opponent starts with 10,000LP.<br />
And you have no way to regenerate your LP between duels without going back to your house !<br />
<br />
Pegasu’s island is the one of the worst and most difficult marathons i ever played,<br />
i don’t think i would have make it without save states…<br />
<br />
After some of the most insane duels, you finally face off Sol Chevalsky,<br />
which is none other than Pegasus being brainwashed by Reshef with a new haircut.<br />
<br />
He starts with 20,000Lp and he uses 3 copies of Restrict, which can steal your monsters.<br />
Again, you are limited to 1 limited card but he uses 3 copies of them x_x<br />
<br />
But after you beat him, it’s not over yet !<br />
You’re about to face Reshef and he’s brutal…<br />
<br />
He starts with 40,000lp, he has all the God cards, he has some of the most powerful cards in the game.<br />
Not only that, but he has game-breaking cards like Change of Heart, Dark Hole, Torrential Tribute,<br />
Raigeki etc… and the only cards immune to them are god cards !<br />
<br />
<img src="/images/reshef-6.png" />
<br />
He’s constanly destroying your monsters, he keeps stealing your monsters, he’s swarming you with lots
of monsters and he’s stalling you with Swords of Revealing Light until he summon Ra.<br />
If he summons Ra, Game Over because he will use it’s special ability to convert his LP to effect damage, which means your death.<br />
<br />
Despite the fact i cheated, i lost countless of times to him.<br />
But i eventually managed to win by summoning Ra before him.<br />
<br />
<b>Conclusion</b>
<br />
The game’s difficulty is brutal but it’s not based on your skills and it is by no means fair.<br />
To make up for the game’s limited AI, it gave them enormous Life points and no restrictions on cards.<br />
It also made the cards much more expensive to buy, while giving you very few DP.<br />
As you soon as you get better cards, <b>the game becomes suddenly easier</b>.<br />
This is difficulty done wrong.<br />
<br />
No sane human being can finish this game without spending a year trying to finish it or without cheats.<br />
<br />
This is probably one of the hardest game in the series, if not the hardest.<br />
<br />
On the upside, the plot is definitively interesting.<br />
It’s an alternative take on the OG series and it’s quite surprising seeing Bandit Keith<br />
actually causing trouble.<br />
But it’s not worth the investment required, unless you intend to cheat of course.<br />
<br />
The game also suffers from annoying issues like the crappy countinous effect detector.<br />
Summon Silfer and the game will remind you that its attack gets increased based on your hand,<br />
each fucking time a move is made : It can pop up like 5 times each turn ! <br />
Why even bother konami ?<br />
<br />
Try it if you have 1 year to waste and want a challenge.<br />
(or you want to cheat and see the plot by yourself)<br /></p>
